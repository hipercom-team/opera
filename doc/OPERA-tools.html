<h1>Tools for OPERA</h1>

This is the documentation for
<ul>
<li>TkModuleManagement.py</li>
<li>PacketAnalysis.py</li>
<li>NetworkAnalysis.py</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Installation</h1>

The tools are written in Python and some of them require external software:
<ul>
<li>A version <strong>2.x</strong> of the language Python (<strong>not 3.x</strong>); <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/">see the latest 2.x version</a>.<br> The module was tested on 
Windows XP with 
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/">Python 2.7.2</a>,
with the Windows MSI Installer 
(<a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi">Python 2.7.2 (32 bits)</a> or 
<a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.amd64.msi">Python 2.7.2 (64 bits) [untested]</a>)
<li>A version of <a href="http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/">PySerial</a>, a Python module which allows 
cross-platform access to the serial port.<br>
The module was tested on Windows XP with version 2.5 and the MS Windows
installer (<a href=http://pypi.python.org/packages/any/p/pyserial/pyserial-2.5.win32.exe>pyserial-2.5.win32.exe</a>).

<li>A version of <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php">Graphviz</a>. This module was tested on Windows XP with
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/stable/windows/graphviz-2.28.0.msi">version 2.28.0 and MSI installer</a>.

</li>
</ul>

<h1>TkModuleManagement.py</h1>

(requires: Python 2.x, PySerial)

<p>
The module sends commands to the serial port, and displays the output.<br>
It is a very simplified equivalent of ZTC for OPERA commands.<br>

<h2>Command line mode</h2>
Internally, TkModuleManagement.py is built on a command line mode, so that 
for any button clicked there is an equivalent command line.<br>
For instance, the button "[1] DeviceInfo" is equivalent to 
<pre>python ModuleManagement.py device-info --port 1</pre>
The equivalent command line is displayed in the GUI when starting a command
from the button; it is the part displayed after "<tt>** running:</tt>"

<h2>GUI mode</h2>

Double click on the program <tt>TkModuleManagement.py</tt>
(alternatively: edit with IDLE editor [installed with Python], and 
press "F5" [Run Module])

<p>
On the right of the GUI, the buttons are organized in a grid, 
which are used to perform
commands. The area of the left, the <em>output area</em>, displays
results of commands.</p>

<p>
The first row of buttons consists:
<ul>
<li>QUIT: quit the application</li>
<li>Clear: clear the output area</li>
<li>AutoClear: clear the output area before running any command</li>
<li>verbose: also display the actual codes (bytes) send to and received from
the serial port (as ZTC).</li>
</ul>
</p>

The rest of the grid is organized with:
<p>
<ul><li>Each column corresponds to a serial port index. The serial port
is specified in the beginning of the button: "[all]" indicates
that the command should be run on all the detected serial ports ; "[1]"
on the serial port number 1, "[2]" on serial port number 2 etc.</li>
<li>Upon starting, the program scans ports 0 to 9, to see which ones are
available, and for every (that can be opened), a  row is created.
</ul>
<p>

The list of commands associated to each node are:<br>
<em>Generic Module Commands</em>
<ul>
  <li><tt>HayesMode</tt>:<br>switch the serial port of the module to 
Hayes Mode,
<strong>this must be made before sending any other command</strong> 
(and also after soft/hard reset (?))
  </li>
  <li><tt>DeviceInfo</tt>:<br>
get device information: IEEE MAC address and device type
  </li>
  <li><tt>Assoc.</tt>:<br>
check if node is associated and get short address
  </li>
  <li><tt>Flush</tt>:<br>
write all the output of the serial port 
  </li>
  <li><tt>Dump</tt>:<br>
get information of some of configuration (from Telit ZigBee module doc)
  </li>
  <li><tt>Start</tt>:<br>
start networking (XXX: not working?)
  </li>
  <li><tt>Soft Reset</tt>:<br>
perform a soft-reset of the node (XXX: not working?); use 'HayesMode' afterwise
  </li>
  <li><tt>Hard Reset</tt>:<br>
perform a hard-reset of the node  (XXX: not working?); use 'HayesMode' afterwise
  </li>
</ul>

<em>OPERA commands</em>
<ul>
  <li><tt>EOND Start</tt>:<br>
start sending periodic Hello message (i.e. start EOLSR Neighbor Discovery)
  </li>
  <li><tt>[!]STC</tt>:<br>
start sending periodic STC as root of a non-colored, 
used for routing [not tested yet]
  </li>
  <li><tt>[!!!]ColSTC</tt>:<br>
start sending STC as <strong>root of the colored tree</strong>,
used for routing. <strong>This is the way to start SERENA</strong>, in
several phases: first the tree which will be colored by SERENA is built; 
after it is stable, the "stability" information is propagated to the root;
then SERENA is started.
  </li>
  <li><tt>[!!!]IncSTC</tt>:<br>
increment STC tree sequence number. <strong>This is the way to 
restart coloring</strong>. This works only on the root of a colored tree.
  </li>
  <li><tt>RootTreeSeq</tt>:<br>
displays information of tree of which this node is root: 
    <ul><li>the tree mode
        <ul> 
        <li>0x00: node is not root of any tree, </li>
        <li>0x01: root of a non-colored tree</li>
        <li>0x02: root of a colored tree</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>and the associated tree sequence number.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<em>OPERA filtering:</em> at the "Hello" level, OPERA can ignore packets
based on some filters
<ul>
  <li><tt>No Filter</tt>:<br>
remove existing filter, if there is one
</li>
  <li><tt>Filt. Only X</tt>:<br>
accept Hello messages only from node with address <tt>X</tt> (X=0,1,2 in the GUI).
This removes previous filter if there is one.
  <li><tt>Filt. No X</tt>:<br>
reject Hello messages from node with address <tt>X</tt> (X=0,1,2 in the GUI).
This removes previous filter if there is one.
</li>
</ul>

(note: RTS/CTS is disabled on Windows because it blocks the program when
trying to write/read from a non-connected serial port)

<h2>Normal use of the GUI</h2>

The usual way to use the GUI is as follows.

Ensure serial connection is working (this can be done better by ZTC):
<ul>
<li>start with "HayesMode"</li>
<li>check the module is connected and alive with: "DeviceInfo". 
If there is a problem, switch to "verbose" mode to diagnose, maybe try
"Flush" first, and then "HayesMode"/"DeviceInfo" again</li>
<li>once the module answers properly, one knows if it is CPAN or router,
and what is the address. 
<li>then check the association information with "Assoc.". It should 
be "True", for the CPAN if it is started, for a router if it is associated. 
</ul>
Once everything is ok, it is possible to start OPERA submodules:
<ul>
<li>starting EOND with button [EOND start]: this starts the Hello messages on the node, 
by setting the "delay time before starting Hellos" to 0. In current
implementation+compilation options, a node which receives a Hello message,
starts sending Hello messages.</li>
<li>immediately, or after, the construction of the colored tree, and
the coloring itself can be performed. This is done with: the button 
"[!!!]ColSTC" on the CPAN:
  <ul>
  <li>the CPAN will start sending STC messages with the flag indicating
     that they should be colored</li>
  <li>the STC messages will construct a tree</li>
  <li>once the stability information gets its way back to the root
      the CPAN will start coloring and running SERENA</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>It is possible to check that a tree was created by "RootTreeSeq" (see above).
</ul>
Later it is possible to start recoloring:
<ul>
<li>the button "[!!!]IncSTC" indeed increases the "tree sequence number"
of the node, and as a result, this will restart the coloring.</li>
</ul>


Some tips:
<ul>
<li>Because OPERA serial communication sometimes loses messages,
the module automatically re-transmits some commands several times until 
a timeout (~3 sec). As a result, for instance, using "HayesMode"
 on an unconnected interface, results in a delay, before the exception
is shown.
In the output window, every time there is a timeout there is a "@" displayed,
and/or an exception</li>
<li>all OPERA commands should return a result code  
(a code  >= 0xf0 is generally some kind of error)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Spec: Serial Protocol for OPERA</h1>

See at the end of <tt>hipsens-opera.c</tt>.

The general format of a command is similar to ZStack commands, as follows
 (XXX: double check):
<pre>
[cmd size (1 byte)] [opera = 0xfe (1 byte)] [opera cmd code (1 byte)] [...] 
</pre>
the reply is 
<pre>
[reply size (1 byte)] [... reply content ...]
</pre>

<h1>ForwardPacketCapture.py</h1>

(requires: Python 2.x)

<p>
 This program forwards the packets received on a port to another port.<br>
The goal of the program is to forwards packet received from the 
<tt>TI Packet Sniffer</tt> to another machine. This is specially useful when the
code is run in a guest Windows virtual machine, and the packet processing is
made on the Linux host.<br>
  The program also dumps the packets as hexadecimal bytes.
<p>

<hr>
<h1>PacketAnalysis.py</h1>

(requires: Python 2.x)

<p>
This program performs basic packet analysis (for OPERA).
</p>
<p>
It has two modes of input:
<ul>
<li>Live: listen to a given UDP port and receive packets (directly from 
<tt>TI Packet Sniffer</tt>, or indirectly from <tt>ForwardPacketCapture</tt>).
In addition, in <em>Live</em> mode, the program writes them in a file 
in the PCAP format (for wireshark for instance).
</li>
<li>Read: read packets from a given log file in PCAP format.</li>
</ul>
</p>

The program is then used to output:
<ul>
<li>Display: show a parsing of the packets received for OPERA packets</li>
<li>Record network state: write the captured packets (of each kind) of each
nodes, in a temporary file (in Linux <strong>not yet implemented for Windows</strong>).
</li>
</ul>

</p>


<h2>How to run</h2>

<p>
The program requires the <tt>TI Packet Sniffer</tt> running in "broadcast"
mode. This is enabled by launching the Sniffer window, then going in the menu
<tt>Settings</tt>, then <tt>Packet broadcast ...</tt>, then selecting
the  "Broadcast enable" check box. The address should be left as
<tt>127.0.0.255</tt> (any 127.xx.xx.xx address) and the port must
 be <tt>5000</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Once the <tt>TI Packet Sniffer</tt> is started, the program can be run on
Windows by double-clicking on <tt>PacketAnalysis.py</tt>. By default, it
will:
<ul>
<li>Display the parsed OPERA packets</li>
<li>Store the capture as PCAP format in a file 
'ocari-packet-YYYY-MM-DD--HHhMMmSS.log' in the current directory</li>
<li>Store the current state (last captured OPERA packets) 
in a temporary directory (displayed at the start of the program):
  <ul>
  <li><tt>current-packet.pydata</tt></li>
  </ul>

</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>NetworkAnalysis.py</h1>

(requires: Python 2.x, Graphviz)

<p>
This program uses data saved by PacketAnalysis.py to display the
OPERA topology 
</p>

<h2>How to run</h2>
<p>
The program requires that <tt>PacketAnalysis.py</tt> runs, because it
uses its outputs.

<ul>
<li>In practice, <tt>PacketAnalysis.py</tt> writes in temporary
user directory, the recorded packets of each kind for OPERA for each
node in a file (periodically or at each packet). 
</li>
<li>Periodically, NetworkAnalysis.py reads this information from the file,
then construct a graph representation, stores in the "Graphviz" (dot)
file format and call the program 'dot.exe'. "dot.exe" then creates
a png file</li>
<li>At the same time, NetworkAnalysis.py writes a .html file
(with time and a link to this png file), which includes a refresh tag</li>
<li>If opened by a browser this displays the topology as png image. 
NetworkAnalysis.py, at the start, in fact, uses python libraries to
start a webbrowser opening this very page.
</li>
</ul>
